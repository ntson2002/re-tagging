# Recurrent neural network-based models for recognizing requisite and effectuation parts in legal texts


Requirements:

*  Python 2.7, with Numpy and Theano installed.


Two implemented models:

* [lstm-tagger-v4](https://github.com/ntson2002/re-tagging/tree/master/lstm-tagger-v4): Implementation of single BI-LSTM-CRF with additional features to recognize non-overlapping RE parts (1 layer). 

* [multi-lstm](https://github.com/ntson2002/re-tagging/tree/master/multi-lstm-tagger): Implementation of Multilayer BiLSTM-CRF model, and Multilayer BiLSTM-MLP-CRF to recognize overlapping RE parts.
